Since the feature development phase for WildFly 21 has now started, we wanted to highlight the
new security features that we will be working on.

== Planned Features

=== Security Realm Enhancements

https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFCORE-4485[WFCORE-4485] *Support for multiple security realms - Distributed Identities*

* This new feature will make it possible to use multiple security realms by sequentially invoking the each of the configured
realms until a realm that contains the identity is found. More details can be found https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-proposals/pull/291[here].

https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFCORE-4486[WFCORE-4486] *Support for multiple security realms - Failover*

* If a security realm becomes unavailable for some reason, it will be possible to failover to an alternate realm. More details
can be found https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-proposals/pull/261[here].

=== Client Integration

https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ELY-1891[ELY-1891] *Revisit Rest integration with WildFly Elytron - AuthenticationClient for Authentication / SSL*

* This feature looks at security integration for RESTEasy clients. More information about this feature can be found https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-proposals/pull/189[here].

=== Expression Resolution

https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFCORE-4360[WFC0RE-4360] *Support expression resolution backed by a credential store*

* Currently, credential store references can be used anywhere in the model where a credential needs to be specified.
This feature will make it possible to encrypt other attribute values stored in the management model. More details can be found https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-proposals/pull/213[here].

=== Additional Authentication Mechanisms

https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFC0RE-4484[WFC0RE-4484] *Support SSH authentication for Git persistence*

* It will be possible to use SSH authentication via Elytron when using Git to manage and persist your WildFly configuration file.
More details are available https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-proposals/pull/249[here].

https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFCORE-4853[WFC0RE-4853] *Support for HTTP External authentication mechanism*

* This feature adds support for the HTTP External authentication mechanism with Elytron, making it possible to
authenticate a user based on credentials established externally. More details can be found https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-proposals/pull/282[here].

https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WEJBHTTP-43[WEJBHTTP-43] *Ability to use BEARER/JWT authentication when using EJB over HTTP*

* This feature looks at adding support for BEARER/JWT authentication for EJB invocations over HTTP. More details can be found https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-proposals/pull/314[here].

=== SSL/TLS Enhancements

https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFCORE-4842[WFCORE-4842] *Add support for TLSv1.3 using the OpenSSL TLS provider*

* We recently added support for TLS 1.3 for WildFly when using the JSSE TLS provider with Elytron. This feature will also
add support for TLS 1.3 when using the OpenSSL TLS provider with Elytron. More information can be found https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-proposals/pull/288[here].

https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ELY-1996[ELY-1996] *SSLContext to support delegation to alternate instances based on peer information*

* As an `SSLEngine` is created, the host and port information is available at the time the engine is requested. This feature
looks at making use of this information to dynamically select alternative configurations.

== Summary

As usual, please keep in mind that this blog post is a summary of our general plans and not a guarantee
that each of these features will be merged for WildFly 21. However, this blog post does give an indication
of our teamâ€™s current priorities. If any of these features are a priority for you, please let us know.
Please also let us know if there are any security features that are missing that you would like to see
prioritized as we can take this kind of feedback into account for future releases.
