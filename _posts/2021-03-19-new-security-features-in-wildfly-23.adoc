This blog post highlights the new security features that are in WildFly 23 and also gives an update
on the new security features that the Elytron team has been working on.

== New Features in WildFly 23

=== Encrypted Expression Support

WildFly 23 now adds support for encrypted expressions within the management model. For details on how to
quickly get started with this new feature, check out this https://wildfly-security.github.io/wildfly-elytron/blog/wildfly-encrypted-expressions/[blog post].

=== Principal Propagation

In certain cases, the principal associated with an unsecured EJB can differ depending on whether Elytron or legacy
security is in use. WildFly 23 makes it possible for users to decide which behaviour they would like to use.
More information can be found in this https://wildfly-security.github.io/wildfly-elytron/blog/normalization-of-EJB-principal-propagation/[blog post].

=== Support for MicroProfile JWT 1.2

The version of MicroProfile JWT supported by WildFly has been upgraded to version 1.2. More
information about what's new in MicroProfile JWT 1.2 can be found https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-jwt-auth/releases/tag/1.2[here].

== In Progress Features

The Elytron team has also been working on many other new features during the WildFly 23 development phase. Although
these features weren't quite ready to be included in WildFly 23, we hope to include them in a future WildFly release.
Here's a quick update on these features.

=== SSL/TLS enhancements

https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ELY-1996[ELY-1996] *SSLContext to support delegation to alternate instances based on peer information*

* This feature looks at making use of the host and port information of the peer that we are
connecting to in order to dynamically select which SSL context to use. More information about how this
new feature will be configured can be found in this https://wildfly-security.github.io/wildfly-elytron/blog/sslcontext-delegation-to-alternate-instances-based-on-peer/[blog post].

https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFCORE-5120[WFCORE-5120] *Automatic registration of a client side / JVM wide default SSLContext*

* This feature will make it possible to register a JVM wide default SSL context for libraries that make use of Elytron
client configuration. Additional information on the plans for this feature can be found https://wildfly-security.github.io/wildfly-elytron/blog/automatic-registration-of-client-side-jvm-wide-default-sslcontext/[here].

https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFCORE-5170[WFCORE-5170] *Support for multiple certificate revocation lists*

* This feature will make it possible to configure multiple certificate revocation lists (e.g., for the case where more
than one certificate authority is being used). An introduction to this feature can be found in this https://wildfly-security.github.io/wildfly-elytron/blog/new-ssl-features/[blog post].

https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFCORE-5145[WFCORE-5145] *Elytron server-ssl-context allowed protocols*

* This enhancement allows an additional legacy protocol to be configured for SSL contexts to provide feature
parity with legacy security. More information can be found in this https://wildfly-security.github.io/wildfly-elytron/blog/new-ssl-features/[blog post].

=== Security Realm Enhancements

https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFCORE-5027[WFCORE-5027] *Security Realms should support specifying the charset and encoding for credentials*

* This feature will make it possible for security realms to store hashed passwords in hex format, in addition to
Base64 format. It will also make it possible to configure the character set to use when processing a user's
password. An introduction to this new feature can be found in this https://wildfly-security.github.io/wildfly-elytron/blog/upcoming-hash-encodings/[blog post].

=== OpenID Connect

https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-14017[WFLY-14017] *Native support for OpenID Connect*

* WildFly currently provides the ability to secure deployments using https://openid.net/connect/[OpenID Connect] (OIDC)
by installing a Keycloak https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/securing_apps/#_jboss_adapter[client adapter].
By adding native support for OpenID Connect to Elytron, the Keycloak client adapter will no longer be needed
to secure applications deployed to WildFly using OIDC. More details can be found https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-proposals/pull/341[here].
