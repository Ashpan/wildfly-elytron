Since the feature development phase for WildFly 23 has now started, we wanted to highlight the
security features that we will be working on. As usual, please keep in mind that this blog post
is a summary of our general plans and not a guarantee that each of these features will be merged
for WildFly 23.

== Planned Features

=== Expression Resolution

https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFCORE-4360[WFC0RE-4360] *Support expression resolution backed by a credential store*

* Currently, credential store references can be used anywhere in the model where a credential needs to be specified.
This feature will make it possible to encrypt other attribute values stored in the management model. More details can be found https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-proposals/pull/213[here].

=== SSL/TLS Enhancements

https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ELY-1996[ELY-1996] *SSLContext to support delegation to alternate instances based on peer information*

* The host and port information of the peer that we are connecting to is available when an `SSLEngine` is being created.
This feature looks at making use of this information to dynamically select which SSL context to use. More information can be found https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-proposals/pull/328[here].

https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFCORE-5120[WFCORE-5120] *Automatic registration of a client side / JVM wide default SSLContext*

* This feature will make it possible to register a JVM wide default SSL context for libraries that make use of Elytron
client configuration. Additional information can be found https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-proposals/pull/336[here].

https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFCORE-5170[WFCORE-5170] *Support for multiple certificate revocation lists*

* Currently, it is only possible to configure a trust manager to make use of one certificate revocation list. This
feature will make it possible to configure multiple certificate revocation lists (e.g., for the case where more
than one certificate authority is being used). More details on this can be found https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-proposals/pull/345[here].

=== Principal Propagation

https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-14074[WFLY-14074] *Normalization of principal propagation/injection across Elytron and Legacy security*

* In certain cases, the principal associated with an unsecured EJB can differ depending on whether Elytron or legacy
security is in use. This feature will make it possible for users to decide which behaviour they would like to use.
More information can be found https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-proposals/pull/346[here].

=== Security Realm Enhancements

https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFCORE-5027[WFCORE-5027] *Security Realms should support specifying the charset and encoding for credentials*

* This feature will make it possible for security realms to store hashed passwords in hex format, in addition to
Base64 format. It will also make it possible to configure the character set to use when processing a user's
password. More details can be found https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-proposals/pull/323[here].

=== OpenID Connect

https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-14017[WFLY-14017] *Native support for OpenID Connect*

* WildFly currently provides the ability to secure deployments using https://openid.net/connect/[OpenID Connect] (OIDC)
by installing a Keycloak https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/securing_apps/#_jboss_adapter[client adapter].
By adding native support for OpenID Connect to Elytron, the Keycloak client adapter will no longer be needed
to secure applications deployed to WildFly using OIDC. More details can be found https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-proposals/pull/341[here].

== Summary

This blog post has highlighted the security features that we will be working on. If any of these features
are a priority for you, please let us know. Please also let us know if there are any security features that
are missing that you would like to see prioritized as we can take this kind of feedback into account
for future releases.
