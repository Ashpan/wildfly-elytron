A couple weeks ago, the https://wildfly-security.github.io/wildfly-elytron/[WildFly Elytron] team had a great time
participating in https://ghc.anitab.org/programs-and-awards/open-source-day/[Open Source Day],
an all-day hackathon that took place during the virtual https://ghc.anitab.org/[Grace Hopper Celebration] (vGHC). This was
the WildFly Elytron team's second time participating in this event, after having been a part of the recent Summer Open
Source Day as well. Once again, we were thrilled to see participants, project representatives, and mentors
come together from all over the globe for this virtual event. The goal of Open Source Day is to guide participants through
making contributions to open source projects.

From the very beginning of the day, we could tell that this would be an even larger event than the Summer Open Source Day.
We kicked things off with some introductory comments from Caitlyn Georger, the event program manager, and Rocio Montes, the chair
of the event. It was then time to
introduce our WildFly Elytron team members and mentors. Open Source Day mentors are volunteers who assist participants
with their contributions for a particular project throughout the day. We were lucky to have 4 mentors join our WildFly
Elytron team members to help our participants. We were also delighted that one of these mentors was actually one of our
participants during the Summer Open Source Day!

After the initial introductions, it was time to jump into an overview of our project. We then covered some
general information on how to submit pull requests against the https://github.com/wildfly-security/wildfly-elytron[wildfly-elytron] repository.
After that, it was time to start the hackathon!

Prior to the event, we had created a bunch of issues and triaged existing ones that would be suitable for anyone getting
started on the WildFly Elytron project. We made sure that the descriptions of these issues had useful pointers for
tackling the tasks. We also added the https://issues.redhat.com/issues/?filter=12364234["good-first-issue"]
label to these issues to make them easy to spot. We shared this list of issues with participants and helped them pick which
ones to work on.

Throughout the day, the WildFly Elytron team members and mentors helped participants set up their development environment,
answered questions about Git and the process of submitting and updating pull requests, helped participants work on their
issues, and provided feedback on their pull requests. There was also some time for general questions about working on
open source projects. We ended the day with several pull requests submitted from first time contributors (we actually
doubled our numbers from the Summer Open Source Day)!

== Some thoughts from our first time contributors and mentors

The WildFly Elytron team thoroughly enjoyed being a part of this event! It was a great way to end the virtual Grace Hopper
Celebration. What did some of our first time contributors and mentors think of the day? Here's what they had to say:

I would like to say that as a student that just finished her 2nd year in software engineering in security I learned
a lot about cyber security and what potential work I could be doing in the future. In the short time I was on call
with the team, everyone was so supportive and I felt welcome even though I didn’t have a lot of knowledge.
I really appreciate that as someone who doesn’t have a lot of experience. Working with individuals in the industry
is a great privilege because I get to learn skills I wouldn’t otherwise learn in the classroom! I hope to keep
contributing to the wildfly elytron repository as a novice in this field!

Before participating in the Open Source Day, I had no idea how contributing to Open Source works. Everything seemed
so complicated that I was seriously doubting I would be able to make a contribution. Luckily, mentors of the
WildFly Elytron team answered all of my questions and helped me navigate my way through GitHub. In the end, I
learned how the whole process of contributing to projects looks like and was able to push several commits of my own
to the project!

It was my first time mentoring for an Open Source Day event, and I couldn't have asked for a better team.
Every team member of Wildfly Elytron was humble and provided their technical expertise on navigating through docs,
setting up the project locally, and sharing tips on how to be a successful OSD mentor. I enjoyed my time working with
WildFly Elytron folks and hope to contribute more in the future!

It was an amazing experience for me to work with all the mentors. It was a first time experience for me as a mentor
in Open Source Day. That helps me to upskill myself. Also I learned a lot about next generation security applications
through the wildfly-elytron project with the support of you guys. I'm exploring more about this project and looking
forward to start contributing to this project.

I first worked with Farah, Ashpan, Sonia, and Diana during OSD summer. Their enthusiasm encouraged me to make my
first open-source contributions over the summer. To contribute back to the community, I decided to come back to
the Wildly Elytron project as a mentor during vGHC 2021. It was gratifying introducing people to open source
development while learning more about the project from the team. Along with more technical details, the team’s
approach towards introducing open-source development to new contributors is something I’ll take away from this event.
