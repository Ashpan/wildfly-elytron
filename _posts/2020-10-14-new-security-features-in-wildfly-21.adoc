This blog post highlights the new security features that are in WildFly 21.

== Security Realm Enhancements

If a security realm becomes unavailable for some reason, it is now possible to fail over to an alternate security
realm.

WildFly 21 also adds support for distributed security realms, where identities can be stored in multiple security
realms. When retrieving an identity from a distributed security realm, each of the configired realms is invoked
sequentially until a realm containing the identity is found.

For an overview of these two new realm implementations, check out this https://wildfly-security.github.io/wildfly-elytron/blog/distributed-and-failover-realms/[blog post].

== Client Integration

It's now possible for RESTEasy clients to make use of authentication information like credentials and SSL configuration
from an Elytron client configuration file. Check out this https://wildfly-security.github.io/wildfly-elytron/blog/resteasy-elytron-client-integration/[blog post]
to see an example of how to make use of this new feature.

== Additional Authentication Mechanisms

When using a remote Git repository to manage your WildFly configuration file history, it's now possible to
connect to your Git repository using SSH authentication. For details on how to specify the SSH
credentials that are needed to connect to your Git repository, take a look at this
https://wildfly-security.github.io/wildfly-elytron/blog/ssh-auth-for-git-persistence/[blog post].

Support for the HTTP External authentication mechanism has now been added to WildFly. This means that
it is now possible for WildFly to authenticate a user based on credentials established externally.
More details can be found in this https://wildfly-security.github.io/wildfly-elytron/blog/http-external-mechanism/[blog post].

== TLS 1.3 Support with OpenSSL

A little while ago, we added support for TLS 1.3 for WildFly when using the JSSE TLS provider. WildFly 21 now
adds support for TLS 1.3 when using the OpenSSL TLS provider. As with the JSSE TLS provider, there is an important
caveat to be aware of when using the OpenSSL TLS provider with TLS 1.3. If JDK 11 is in use and if there is a very
large number of TLS 1.3 requests being made, it is possible that a drop in performance (throughput and response time)
will occur compared to when using TLS 1.2 with WildFly. It is recommended to test for performance degradation prior
to enabling TLS 1.3 in a production environment. Take a look at this
https://wildfly-security.github.io/wildfly-elytron/blog/tls-13-with-wildfly-openssl/[blog post]
to learn how to enable TLS 1.3 when using the OpenSSL TLS provider.
